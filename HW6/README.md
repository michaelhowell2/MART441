Was a challenging assignment.  I still occasionaly have issues where I click on the image it stays revealed even though it is the wrong one, or if I do get right ones the flip still. Also after revealling them all they don't go to the end page sometimes. I'm not sure what the fix for it is. I added a small timere but that did not work. Only thing that guarantees a complete is slow clicks on each image.
