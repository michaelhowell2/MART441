I have attatched the AI response to the assignment. I could not get it to work. I am assuming it is becasue the html is not linked to the js. I also asked copilot to add images and it said it could not. Overall a big fail initially with copilot but i'm sure with more prompts I could get more out of it. I also am having trouble making my code work in GitHub Pages. It works fine in VScode live server but wont load in pages...I can mimic this by breaking my link to js and css in studio code so I'm assumiong there is an issue in GitHUb with the file structure...I had to add a.. to the sketch and js to make it work on pages. So now should be good to go I hope.
