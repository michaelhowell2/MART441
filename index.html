            Hi, I'm Michael Howell! I'm an older student returning to school to finish my Bachelor's degree in Media Arts. I started in music production which evolved into journalism and then photography. I was then drawn to UM's Online art degree but missed out on it. The advisor suggested the Media Arts porgram, so here I am in my final (hopefully) semester. I currently enjoy drawing, writing, and occasionaly making bad music with synthesizers. I try to play games when I can. I like mmo's like Warcraft and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, I also love Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Outer Worlds and similar games to those Genres. I work full time with a significant amount of overtime,as a wastewater operator so I have to use my time wisely for school, work, and hobbies. I also do photography on the side, mostly racing photos with the occasionally family/senior portraits. I had a photobiz website but hopefully I can learn enough soon to do my own! Coding is new to me I have never played with coding until my creative coding class last spring and the web design class in the summer of 2024. I look forward to adding more information and knowledge  to my brain </p>

        <h2>A Memorable Gaming Moment</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite gaming moment was the release of Star Wars Galaxies many many years ago. The game at the time was just amazing. Sandbox Star Wars games where one could live out their Star Wars fantasies to their own choosing. You could be a crafter, merchant, bounty hunter, almost anything your heart desired. Building and decorating houses, a unique crafting system, It was just awesome at the time! I met many lifelong friends through guilds. I still am in touch with a few of my gaming friends 20 or so years later..
