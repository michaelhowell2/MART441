I changed it up from stars and bombs to beers and poo and slime.  The Poo are killing "bombs" and slime are  spikey but only slow you down. There should be 12 "rounds" of beer until last call.the hotdog is kinda weird but cool haha spacebar jumps. Scenes change every 3 or 4 rounds from day to dusk to night. I had little bit of trouble figuring out how to do a power up  but finnaly got it to sort of work out. Only issue I have is if you go through slime you loose thr powerup animation even though you still powered up.
