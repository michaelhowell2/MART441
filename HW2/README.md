 I used copilot just copy and pasted your words into the box and it generated something similar to what I have.  I'm sure the simpler the code is the more it shares with each other.  I did learn what placimgh an n in front  the word does so I incorporated that into mine. Example: ("\nFavorite Games:"); I think you could probably  do some pretty decent coding with AI but i'm not sure you could put out quality work without inspecting it and adding the "human touch" to it. AI didn't give pictures to add. I see using AI as maybe a collabrative tool helping someone work through things they may not understand like hey co piolit what does this mean...("\nFavorite Games:");? and it says..."The line console.log("\nFavorite Games:"); contains:

    \n:
        This is a newline character. It instructs the console to start a new line before printing "Favorite Games:".
        It's used to make the console output more organized and easier to read by adding blank lines between different sections of the output.

    console.log:
        This is used to display the string "Favorite Games:" in the console."   Saving me some research time. 

        So in closing I would say Generative AI is valuable for learning, brainstorming, general chatting; (hey sometimes my pets get bored of me) But one has to still add their touch to a generative AI. The AI picked generic sites. The games and artists do not necessarly match my likes so no I would not feel like this is "mine."
