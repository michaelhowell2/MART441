Had some troubles remembering some aspects of MART341. I took it in Summer 0f 2024 when we were the first class to switch to Canvas and there were many hiccups. I had to research what parallax is and played around with it. I still not sure about it. I also had to learn what a Hero Image is. I bought a w3 I kind of like how this turned out but would like to tweak it some more but I need to brush up on coding again. Last semester I took all graphic design and illustrator courses so I'm rusty. This assignment jarred some memories loose though. I'm taking mostly coding classes this semester so I better get better fast!
